Personal Portfolio Enhancement Project

Greetings! This is the README for my personal portfolio enhancement project.

The website is very simple:

The home page contains an introduction and a brief bio.

The "ABOUT" button leads to a page that briefly summarizes my background, education, and career goals, as well as lists some of my personal interests.

The "RESUMÉ" button leads to a page that contains most of the pertinent information from my resumé, including my skills, education, work experience, and certifications.

Happy browsing!
